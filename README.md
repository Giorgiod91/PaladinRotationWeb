This project was created out of a need for a reliable tool to simulate Holy Paladin characters in World of Warcraft. While there are many tools available for other classes, I found that there was a lack of dedicated simulators specifically tailored for Holy Paladins.

As a passionate player, I wanted to create something that would not only help me improve my gameplay but also assist others in the community who share the same goals. Using Java, I developed a backend engine that accurately models the complex interactions of a Holy Paladin's abilities and stats.

My aim is to provide a platform that allows players to test and optimize their builds, ensuring they can perform at their best in raids and dungeons. This project is continuously evolving, and Iâ€™m excited to keep improving it based on feedback from the community.
